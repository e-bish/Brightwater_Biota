# Brightwater_Biota

This is a repository to store information for replicating the analyses in Dethier et al. (in prep). 

## Folder structure

Running the code in Brightwater_biota_analysis_script.R will replicate all analyses. This file pulls data from the folder **raw_data** and writes figure images to files in the folder **figures**.
